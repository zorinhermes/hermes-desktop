/**
 * `reconcileStreamedWithDb` is the end-of-stream merge between the
 * in-memory streamed transcript and the canonical `state.db` rows
 * returned by `getSessionMessages`.
 *
 * Two cases drive the design:
 *
 *   1. Today — DeepSeek (and o1/o3) emit `reasoning_content` over SSE
 *      but the gateway (NousResearch/hermes-agent#30449) doesn't
 *      forward it. So reasoning + tool rows only exist in state.db.
 *      The merge must ADD those rows so the user sees them without
 *      a window-focus dance.
 *
 *   2. After upstream #30449 lands — reasoning streams in real time
 *      with a renderer-side id like `reasoning-${ts}`. The merge
 *      must KEEP that streamed id so React doesn't re-mount the
 *      already-rendered bubble when the DB version (id `db-r-…`)
 *      arrives at end-of-stream.
 *
 * Both behaviours are pinned below.
